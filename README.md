‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Workflow Engine
A minimal but robust backend service built with .NET 8 that implements a configurable state-machine API. This project was created as a take-home exercise for the Infonetica Software Engineer Intern role.

‚ú® Features
Define Workflows: Dynamically create workflow blueprints with custom states and actions.

Instantiate & Execute: Start instances from any definition and execute actions to transition between states.

Full Validation: The engine enforces all state-machine rules, such as ensuring actions are valid from the current state and that workflows have exactly one initial state.

Inspect State: Retrieve the current state and a complete history of actions for any running instance.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
.NET 8 SDK

Installation & Running
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/abhiraj-ranjan/WorkFlowEngine.git](https://github.com/abhiraj-ranjan/WorkFlowEngine.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd WorkFlowEngine

Run the application:

dotnet run

The API will now be running and listening on the port specified in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5054).

üõ†Ô∏è API Usage
You can interact with the API using curl or any API client.

(Note: Replace [your_port] in the examples below with the actual port number from your terminal.)

1. Create a Workflow Definition
Send a POST request to /workflows to define a new workflow.

curl -X POST "http://localhost:[your_port]/workflows" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "id": "doc-approval",
  "states": [
    { "id": "draft", "isInitial": true },
    { "id": "in-review" },
    { "id": "approved", "isFinal": true },
    { "id": "rejected", "isFinal": true }
  ],
  "actions": [
    { "id": "submit-for-review", "fromStates": ["draft"], "toState": "in-review" },
    { "id": "approve", "fromStates": ["in-review"], "toState": "approved" },
    { "id": "reject", "fromStates": ["in-review"], "toState": "rejected" }
  ]
}'

2. Start a Workflow Instance
Send a POST request to /workflows/{definitionId}/instances.

curl -X POST "http://localhost:[your_port]/workflows/doc-approval/instances"

Response: This will return a new instance with a unique ID. Copy this ID for the next steps.

3. Execute an Action
Send a POST request to /instances/{instanceId}/actions/{actionId}.

(Replace [INSTANCE_ID] with the ID you copied.)

curl -X POST "http://localhost:[your_port]/instances/[INSTANCE_ID]/actions/submit-for-review"

Response: The instance will now be in the in-review state.

üìù Design & Assumptions
In-Memory Persistence: As required, all data is stored in-memory. Data is lost on application restart.

Single-File Simplicity: The entire application is contained within Program.cs. This was a pragmatic choice to maximize readability and focus on the core logic, avoiding the overhead of a more complex project structure for an exercise of this scope.

Minimal API: The project uses .NET Minimal APIs for clean and concise endpoint definitions.

No Unit Tests: To adhere to the suggested time frame, unit tests were not included. In a production scenario, the service logic would be thoroughly tested to ensure correctness.
